# 🧠 Kalimat – Visual Word Recognition Game

**Kalimat** is an interactive educational web application built with vanilla JavaScript. The game displays a virtual keyboard and a set of images above it. Users are challenged to identify each image and type its name using the on-screen keyboard. It's a fun and engaging way to improve vocabulary, spelling, and visual recognition skills.

## 🎯 Concept

The app combines visual learning with active participation. Each round presents several images (e.g., apple, car, dog), and the user must type the correct  word for each using the provided alphabet keyboard. It's ideal for children, language learners, and anyone looking to sharpen their vocabulary in a playful way.
